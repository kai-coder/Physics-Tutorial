            <h1>Dot Product</h1>
                <p>The dot product is used to see how much of a vector is in the direction of another vector 
                    (known as the scalar product) and its just one simple equation:</p>
                <pre><code>a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y = |a| * |b| * cos(θ)</code></pre>
                <p>I know that looks quite scary, so let's break it down. The symbol <code>θ</code> is just the angle between the two
                    vectors. Also, <code>|a|</code> just means the length of vector <code>a</code> (if you thought it was absolute value you're not 
                    alone).
                </p>
                <p>So how does this equation tell us the information we need?</p>
                <p>Before we get into that, let's substitute <code>a</code> for the difference between the
                    velocities (shown in dark purple) and <code>b</code> as the direction of the 
                    collision normal (the short yellow vector). Because vector <code>b</code>
                    is normalized, meaning it has the length of 1, we can just remove <code>|b|</code> 
                    from the right side of the equation because it has absolutely no effect on the product. 
                    So now the equation looks more like this:
                </p>
                <pre><code>a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y = |a| * cos(θ)</code></pre>
                <p>If you look at the demonstration, you can see that if we drew a line between the dot product 
                    and the velocity difference, it forms a right triangle. You will also notice that the
                    velocity difference is the hypotenuse of that right triangle. 
                </p>
                <p>For those who don't know <code>cos(θ)</code> in a right triangle equals the length of the
                   side (that is not the hypotenuse) next to the angle <code>θ</code>, known as adjacent, 
                   divided by the length of the hypotenuse. Go to
                   <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/cosine.html#:~:text=more%20...,(%CE%B8)%20%3D%20adjacent%20%2F%20hypotenuse" target="_blank">cosine rule</a>
                   for further explanation.
            </p>
                <p>Now by looking at the demonstration, you can also see that the scalar product is the adjacent
                    side of the angle <code>θ</code>. You can now probably see where this is going. Since
                    the equation of <code>cos(θ)</code> is <code>adjacent / hypotenuse</code> or in our case
                    <code>scalar / |a|</code>, if we multiply <code>|a|</code> by <code>cos(θ)</code>, we will
                    get the scalar product.
                </p>
                <p>This scalar product is useful because when scaling (thats why
                    scalar sounds like scale) the normal by the scalar, it results in a vector that is in the
                    direction that we need to change the velocity in.
                </p>
