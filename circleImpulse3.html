            <h1>RESPONSE PT.3</h1>
            <p>Now that we have the circles bouncing off walls, we make it so that 
                the circles interact with one another as well. To do this we will need to update 
                the position of the circles when they collide with one another and calculate their new velocity.
                This lesson is harder than others, and therefore longer, but I have broken it down a lot so it
                shouldn't cause too much trouble. Also it's really worth it!
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, we will create the <code>circleResponse()</code> function inside the class that accepts one circle as an input.
                We will also use our <code>circleCircle()</code> function to check if the circles are colliding.
            </p>

            <pre><code>def circleResponse(self, c2):
    # If circles collided
    if circleCircle(self, c2):</code></pre>
            <p>If they are colliding, we need to calculate the change in velocity on collision.
            </p>
            <p>To begin, we need to determine the direction of the collision normal vector. 
                A normal vector is basically a vector with a length of one and 
                is useful in many ways. Just in this lesson we will use it twice!</p>
            <p>To get the normal vector, we will make use of the Pythagorean Theorem again like so:</p>
            <pre><code>1. a^2 + b^2 = c^2
2. sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(c^2)
3. sqrt(a^2 + b^2) / c = c / c
4. sqrt(a^2 / c^2 + b^2 / c^2) = 1
5. sqrt((a / c)^2 + (b / c)^2) = 1</code></pre>
            <p>As you can see by dividing the X and Y coordinates of the vector (<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the equation) the 
            length of the vector is one. In this case, the vector represents the distance between the 
            first and second circle.</p>
            <p>So to get the normal vector we just need get the difference between the X and Y coordinates to get
                the direction of the collision and divide it by
                the distance between the circles to get the normal like so:</p>
                <pre><code># Direction of collision
dx = c2.x - self.x
dy = c2.y - self.y

# Distance between circles
circleDist = dist(self, c2)

# Direction of collision normal
nx = dx / circleDist
ny = dy / circleDist</code></pre>
            <p>Next, we need to get the difference between the circles' velocities because we
                need it to calculate the total velocity of the collision. This can be easily done like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code># Difference between velocities
vx = self.velx - c2.velx
vy = self.vely - c2.vely</code></pre>
            <p>Okay, this is where it gets a little difficult. We are now going to use the dot product
                to take the vector of the difference between the velocities and see how much of it is
                in the direction of the position normal.
            </p>
            <p>Okay, now we can finally get back to the code.</p>
            <p>So the next thing we will be doing is getting the dot product and multiplying it by 
                <code>-(1 + self.bounce)</code> 
                to determine the total velocity of the collision.
            </p>
            <pre><code># Calculate total velocity
vTotal = -(1 + self.bounce) * (vx * nx + vy * ny)</code></pre>
            <p>We are adding 1 to <code>self.bounce</code> because the collision response wouldn't make sense
                if we didn't.
                For example say <code>self.bounce</code> equals 0 and 1 isn't added to it.
                The total velocity would equal 0, the velocities would not change on collision, 
                and the circles will just pass right
                through each other.</p>
            <p>Next, we need to affect the collided circles' original velocities based off of the total
                collision velocity. To do this we will be multiplying the collision normal by the total 
                collision velocity and have it affect the circles' velocities like so:</p>
            <pre><code># Add total velocity along collision normal
self.velx += nx * vTotal
self.vely += ny * vTotal
c2.velx -= nx * vTotal
c2.vely -= ny * vTotal</code></pre>
                <p>Finally we need to incorporate the mass into the calculation so that heavier objects will be 
                    affected less by the collision than lighter ones. We will be dividing the other circles
                    mass by the total mass to get the percentage of the total velocity that the circle should 
                    be affected by.
                </p>
                <p>We then just multiply the the total velocity by it before affecting the velocities and 
                    we have this:
                </p>
                <pre><code># Add percentage of total velocity along collision normal
self.velx += nx * vTotal * (c2.mass / (self.mass + c2.mass))
self.vely += ny * vTotal * (c2.mass / (self.mass + c2.mass))
c2.velx -= nx * vTotal * (self.mass / (self.mass + c2.mass))
c2.vely -= ny * vTotal * (self.mass / (self.mass + c2.mass))</code></pre>
                <p>Now, all we have to do is run this function in the <code>draw()</code> function. Under
                where we put the <code>boundResponse()</code> function, we will have another for loop check
                every other circle. We also have to change the for loop a little too like so:</p>
<pre><code># Respond to collisions
for i in range(len(circleArr)):
    circleArr[i].boundResponse(0, 0, width, height)

    # Check every other circle
    for j in range(i + 1, len(circleArr)):
        circleArr[i].circleResponse(circleArr[j])
    </code></pre> 
            <p>This method of checking for circle collision reduces the amount of checks required by half.</p>
            <p>You might have notices that the result doesn't match the demonstration at the top, 
                but this was a REALLY hard and long
                lesson so we will fix that in the next lesson (which is much easier by the way).
            </p>
