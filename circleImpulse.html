            <h1>RESPONSE PT.1</h1>
            <p>Now that we are able to detect collisions between circles, we now have to calculate how each
            circle will respond to the collision. This is where things start to become really fun and interesting.
            This lesson is also going to be quite complex so it will be split into XXX parts.
            </p>
            <p>To begin, we will add three extra variables to the circle class that will store the circle's velocity
                and mass. We are going to set the mass as the radius of the circle for now.
            </p>

            <pre><code>self.velx = velx
self.vely = vely
self.mass = radius</code></pre>

            <p>This is important because we need to know the velocity of each circle to know how other circles should
                react to it. Also remember that the circle class needs to be able to accept two extra inputs
                of velx and vely so remember to add that.
            </p>
            <p>We are also going to make an array to store all the circles so we can have some <strong>CIRCLE MADNESS</strong>!</p>
            <p>To begin, we will delete the variables that currently store the two circles and replace
                them with an array.
            </p>
            <pre><code># Create array to store circles
circleArr = []</code></pre>

            <p>Next, in the <code>setup()</code> function we will append 10 circles to the array and assign random attributes
                to them.
            </p>
            <pre><code>for i in range(10):
    # Set random attributes
    x = random(width)
    y = random(height)
    radius = random(5, 50)
    velx = random(-5, 5)
    vely = random(-5, 5)

    # Append circle to array
    circleArr.append(circleCollider(x, y, radius, velx, vely))</code></pre>
            <p>
                If you did this, you probably received an undefined variable error and that is because we need to 
                modify the contents of the <code>draw()</code> function.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of referencing each circle through variables, we can draw all the circles at once
                by using a for loop like so:
            </p>
            <pre><code># Draw every circle
for i in circleArr:
    i.draw()</code></pre>
            <p>
                Your code should now look like this:
            </p>
